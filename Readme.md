# CVE-2023-27532

Proof of Concept code to exploit CVE-2023-27532 and either leak plaintext credentials or perform remote command execution.

## Overview

For a detailed analysis of the vulnerability and exploitation please read the Rapid7 [AttackerKB Analysis](https://attackerkb.com/topics/ALUsuJioE5/cve-2023-27532).

## Building

Open in Visual Studio. You will need to either add or update the references to `Veeam.Backup.Common.dll`, `Veeam.Backup.Interaction.MountService.dll`, and `Veeam.Backup.Model.dll`. To make things easier, install Veeam Backup & Replication on the development machine, although this is not a hard requirement.
